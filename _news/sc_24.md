ðŸŽ‰ I'm happy to announce that the paper *Exploring GPU-to-GPU Communication: Insights into Supercomputer Interconnects* have been accepted at SC '24. The paper focuses on GPU-GPU interconnect. We analyzed three top-10 supercomputers, on up to 4k NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, offering valuable insights to architects, researchers, practitioners, and developers. The paper is the outcome of a fruitful collaboration with NVIDIA, Cray HPE, ETH Zurich, CINECA, University of Trento, Vrije Universitiet, and University of Antwerp. You can find a preprint [here](./assets/pdf/2024_GPUGPU.pdf).
