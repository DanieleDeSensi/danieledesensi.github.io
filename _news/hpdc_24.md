ðŸŽ‰ I'm happy to announce that a new paper have been accepted at HPDC '24. The paper introduces a performance model and new algorithms for reduce and allreduce on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), a novel architecture optimized for machine learning workloads. The new algorithms outperform the current vendor solutions by more than 3x.
