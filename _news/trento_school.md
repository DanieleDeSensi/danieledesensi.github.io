👨‍🏫 In partnership with the University of Trento and CINI, we will host in June a summer school focused on High-Performance Computing (HPC) https://hpc-summer-school-24.disi.unitn.it/. I'll be giving two lectures on interconnection networks and the process of writing HPC papers. If you're interested, feel free to join.
