ðŸŽ‰ I'm happy to announce that two papers have been accepted at NSDI '24. The first one is about a new algorithm for allreduce on multidimensional torus networks that improves performance up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art algorithms (you can find a preprint [here](./assets/pdf/2024_Swing.pdf)). The second one is on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the first-ever Slim Fly network deployment ([here](./assets/pdf/2024_Slimfly.pdf)).
