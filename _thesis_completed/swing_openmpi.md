The allreduce operation is one of the most commonly used communication routines in distributed applications. In this operation, vectors coming from different nodes need to be aggregated element-wise (e.g., by summing elements), and the result distributed back to all the nodes. Estimations show up to 40% of the time spent in the training of large-scale machine learning models is spent performing this operation [1]. To improve its bandwidth and the performance of applications using it, the Swing algorithm has been recently proposed [2], which can improve the performance of the allreduce by up to 3x. 

In this thesis the student will implement the Swing algorithm in OpenMPI [3], one of the most commonly used communication libraries for distributed applications. The implementation will then be evaluated through a set of experiments to be performed on a 50-nodes cluster, as well as on the LUMI and Leonardo supercomputers (currently the 5th and 6th fastest supercomputers in the world). A good knowledge of the C programming language is required. If time allows, the algorithm could also be integrated into PyTorch and/or TensorFlow and evaluated on a set of machine learning applications.
