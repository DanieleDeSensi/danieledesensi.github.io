Simulating large-scale systems using tools like the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) generates a wealth of data about network behavior, communication patterns, and resource utilization. However, analyzing these traces can be challenging without intuitive, interactive visualizations. Leveraging the **Network Traffic Visualizer** [1], this project will create a dynamic visualization framework tailored to SST traces.

The goal of the project is to adapt and extend the **Network Traffic Visualizer** to visualize network traffic data generated by the SST simulator. The visualization will represent the network as a graph, where nodes correspond to routers or endpoints, and links dynamically change color and thickness over time to represent traffic intensity and bandwidth usage. This real-time visualization will help identify bottlenecks, load imbalances, and the impact of different routing algorithms or topologies.

The work will involve:
- Parsing and converting SST simulator trace outputs to a format compatible with the Network Traffic Visualizer tool.
- Integrating additional features into the visualizer, such as traffic filtering (e.g., by specific nodes or links) and support for large-scale networks.
- Benchmarking the tool's scalability and performance when visualizing large SST simulations.
- Conducting case studies on SST-generated network topologies (e.g., Dragonfly, Fat-tree) to demonstrate the toolâ€™s effectiveness.

The tool will serve as a critical resource for analyzing simulated networks, particularly for researchers designing and optimizing interconnects for high-performance computing.

**Skills required**:
- Knowledge of C/C++ and Python programming languages.
