The Tenstorrent Wormhole [1] is a cutting-edge processor architecture designed to accelerate machine learning tasks, particularly deep learning workloads. It integrates a scalable, efficient interconnect and high-performance processing units that make it well-suited for large-scale model training and inference tasks. Understanding how to optimize kernels for such advanced hardware is critical for fully leveraging its capabilities in real-world machine learning applications.

In this thesis, the student will focus on implementing machine learning kernels (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolutions, activation functions) for the Tenstorrent Wormhole architecture using simulation environments. The objective is to evaluate the performance of these kernels in the context of the Wormhole’s unique design and explore ways to optimize these operations for better efficiency.

The student will be tasked with implementing and adapting algorithms to make the best use of the Tenstorrent Wormhole’s architecture, utilizing its interconnect and processing capabilities effectively. The work will involve benchmarking the performance of the kernels on simulated environments, analyzing the scalability and memory usage, and comparing the results against other popular accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs). Additionally, the thesis will explore performance optimizations that can enhance kernel execution on the Wormhole.

**Skills required**:
- Familiarity with C/C++ programming
- Familiarity with CUDA
