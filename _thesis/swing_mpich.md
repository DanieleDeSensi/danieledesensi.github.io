The allreduce operation is widely used in distributed computing for aggregating data across multiple nodes. This operation is crucial in high-performance applications, such as large-scale machine learning, scientific simulations, and data analytics. Despite its importance, it can become a bottleneck due to communication delays. To optimize this, the Swing algorithm was introduced, achieving up to a 3x performance improvement over traditional allreduce methods by leveraging more efficient communication patterns [1].

MPICH [2], a widely used MPI implementation for parallel computing, is commonly employed in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. However, the integration of the Swing algorithm into MPICH is still under-explored. This thesis aims to implement the Swing algorithm within MPICH, enhancing the efficiency of collective operations, particularly allreduce. The implementation will be evaluated on a high-performance cluster, with experiments comparing the performance of the Swing-based solution to traditional methods.

The thesis will include a detailed analysis of MPICH's existing allreduce implementation, followed by the design and integration of the Swing algorithm. If time permits, the solution may also be tested on a real-world application such as machine learning or scientific simulations.

**Skills required**:  
- Proficiency in C programming and MPI  
- Basic understanding of parallel computing concepts  
- Experiences with GPU programming
