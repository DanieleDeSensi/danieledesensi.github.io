I am an Assistant Professor at Sapienza University of Rome. I was previously a PostDoc researcher at ETH ZÃ¼rich and University of Pisa. I received the Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Pisa.

My main reseach interests lie on the fields of Interconnection Networks, Green Computing, Dynamic Runtime Adaptations, Parallel Programming and High Performance Computing.
You can find more about my research by checking the [publications page](/publications/).
